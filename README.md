Introduction to Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization- is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted (such as a byte stream or JSON), while
deserialization - is the reverse process, where data from a storage format is converted back into an object. These processes are essential for persisting data, communication over networks, and integrating different systems.

Benefits of Serialization and Deserialization

1. Data Persistence: Save the state of an object to a file or database so that it can be restored later.
2. Network Communication: Transfer complex data structures between systems over a network.
3. Interoperability: Exchange data between different platforms or languages using common formats like JSON or XML.
4. State Management: Maintain application state across different sessions or system restarts.

Mechanism of Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization:
1. Convert the objectâ€™s state into a series of bytes or a string format.
2. Store or transmit the serialized data.
   
Deserialization:
1. Read the byte stream or string data.
2. Reconstruct the object from the serialized data.

In Java, serialization is achieved using the Serializable interface, which marks a class as eligible for serialization. For deserialization, the ObjectInputStream class is used to reconstruct the object.
